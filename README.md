# Password Strength Checker

This is a JavaScript-based password strength checker that allows users to input a password, and it provides feedback on the strength of the password based on various criteria, including the presence of digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols.

## Features

- Evaluate the strength of the password based on the presence of character types:
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Symbols (!@#$%^&*()_+{}[]:;<>,.?~\/-)
- Display the password strength as a percentage.
